# Loan_Prediction_classifier
The dataset used here is from AnalyticsVidya competition (https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-predic
tion-iii/). I have used Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression for the same. The dataset needed datacleaning and a lil
bit of feature scaling. For accuracy I used Cross validation score, accuracy ,confusion matrix, train and test scores as well. 
However, the dataset can still be modified and manipulated a lot more, I think, to improve the scores.
